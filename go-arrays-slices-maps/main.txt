 weâ€™ll cover:

1. Arrays in Go
2. Slices (Dynamic Arrays)
3. Maps (Key-Value Pairs)
4. Practical Hands-on Tasks

Arrays in Go
An array is a fixed-length collection of elements of the same type.

Slices (Dynamic Arrays in Go)
A slice is a dynamic and resizable version of an array.

Maps (Key-Value Pairs)
A map is a collection of key-value pairs.

ðŸ”§ Hands-on Practical Tasks
âœ… Task 1: Create an array of 5 integers and print each element using a loop.
âœ… Task 2: Create a slice, append elements to it, and print its length and capacity.
âœ… Task 3: Slice an array into two parts and print both.
âœ… Task 4: Create a map of student names and their scores, add a new student, and delete one.
âœ… Task 5: Write a function to return the highest score from a map of student marks.
