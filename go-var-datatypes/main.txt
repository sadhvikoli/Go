weâ€™ll cover:

1. Declaring Variables (var vs :=)
2. Constants (const)
3. Primitive Data Types
4. Type Conversion
5. Zero Values in Go
6. Practical Hands-on Tasks


Data Types in Go
Go has four main types:

Basic types: int, float64, bool, string
Composite types: array, slice, map, struct
Reference types: pointers, functions, channels
Interface types: interface{}


Type Conversion in Go
Go does not support implicit type conversion. You must explicitly convert types.

Zero Values in Go
If a variable is declared but not initialized, it gets a zero value.
Integers default to 0.
Floats default to 0.0.
Booleans default to false.
Strings default to "" (empty string).

ðŸ”§ Hands-on Practical Tasks
âœ… Task 1: Write a program that declares variables using both var and := and prints their values.
âœ… Task 2: Declare constants for pi, gravity, and speedOfLight and print them.
âœ… Task 3: Write a program that converts an integer to a float and prints the result.
âœ… Task 4: Declare variables without assigning values and print their zero values.
