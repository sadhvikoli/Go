we'll cover:

1. If-Else Statements
2. Switch Case Statements
3. Loops in Go (for, range)
4. Practical Hands-on Tasks


 Switch-Case in Go
Instead of multiple if-else statements, use switch.

Switch Without break
Unlike other languages, Go does not require break, as cases exit automatically.

Loops in Go (For & Range)
Go has only one loop: for loop. There is no while or do-while loop.

ðŸ”§ Hands-on Practical Tasks
âœ… Task 1: Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else.
âœ… Task 2: Use a switch statement to print the name of the day based on a number (1-7).
âœ… Task 3: Write a for loop to print numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.
âœ… Task 4: Create a multiplication table program using a loop.
âœ… Task 5: Iterate over an array of names using range and print them.
